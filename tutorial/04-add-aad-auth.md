In this exercise you will extend the application from the previous exercise to support authentication with Azure AD. This is required to obtain the necessary OAuth access token to call the Microsoft Graph. In this step you will integrate the [omniauth-oauth2](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-oauth2) gem into the application, and create a custom OmniAuth strategy.

1. Create a separate file to hold your app ID and secret. Create a new file called `oauth_environment_variables.rb` in the **./config** folder, and add the following code.

    :::code language="ruby" source="../demo/graph-tutorial/config/oauth_environment_variables.rb.example":::

1. Replace `YOUR_APP_ID_HERE` with the application ID from the Application Registration Portal, and replace `YOUR_APP_SECRET_HERE` with the password you generated.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you're using source control such as git, now would be a good time to exclude the `oauth_environment_variables.rb` file from source control to avoid inadvertently leaking your app ID and password.

1. Open **./config/environment.rb** and add the following code before the `Rails.application.initialize!` line.

    :::code language="ruby" source="../demo/graph-tutorial/config/environment.rb" id="LoadOAuthSettingsSnippet" highlight="4-6":::

## Setup OmniAuth

You've already installed the `omniauth-oauth2` gem, but in order to make it work with the Azure OAuth endpoints, you need to [create an OAuth2 strategy](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-oauth2#creating-an-oauth2-strategy). This is a Ruby class that defines the parameters for making OAuth requests to the Azure provider.

1. Create a new file called `microsoft_graph_auth.rb` in the **./lib**`** folder, and add the following code.

    :::code language="ruby" source="../demo/graph-tutorial/lib/microsoft_graph_auth.rb" id="AuthStrategySnippet":::

    Take a moment to review what this code does.

    - It sets the `client_options` to specify the Microsoft identity platform endpoints.
    - It specifies that the `scope` parameter should be sent during the authorize phase.
    - It maps the `id` property of the user as the unique ID for the user.
    - It uses the access token to retrieve the user's profile from Microsoft Graph to fill in the `raw_info` hash.
    - It overrides the callback URL to ensure that it matches the registered callback in the app registration portal.

1. Create a new file called `omniauth_graph.rb` in the **./config/initializers** folder, and add the following code.

    :::code language="ruby" source="../demo/graph-tutorial/config/initializers/omniauth_graph.rb" id="ConfigureOmniAuthSnippet":::

    This code will execute when the app starts. It loads up the OmniAuth middleware with the `microsoft_graph_auth` provider, configured with the environment variables set in **oauth_environment_variables.rb**.

## Implement sign-in

Now that the OmniAuth middleware is configured, you can move on to adding sign-in to the app.

1. Run the following command in your CLI to generate a controller for sign-in and sign-out.

    ```Shell
    rails generate controller Auth
    ```

1. Open **./app/controllers/auth_controller.rb**. Add a callback method to the `AuthController` class. This method will be called by the OmniAuth middleware once the OAuth flow is complete.

    ```ruby
    def callback
      # Access the authentication hash for omniauth
      data = request.env['omniauth.auth']

      # Temporary for testing!
      render json: data.to_json
    end
    ```

    For now all this does is render the hash provided by OmniAuth. You'll use this to verify that sign-in is working before moving on.

1. Add the routes to **./config/routes.rb**.

    ```ruby
    # Add route for OmniAuth callback
    match '/auth/:provider/callback', :to => 'auth#callback', :via => [:get, :post]
    ```

1. Start the server and browse to `https://localhost:3000`. Click the sign-in button and you should be redirected to `https://login.microsoftonline.com`. Login with your Microsoft account and consent to the requested permissions. The browser redirects to the app, showing the hash generated by OmniAuth.

            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Storing the tokens

Now that you can get tokens, it's time to implement a way to store them in the app. Since this is a sample app, for simplicity's sake, you'll store them in the session. A real-world app would use a more reliable secure storage solution, like a database.

1. Open **./app/controllers/application_controller.rb**. Add the following method to the `ApplicationController` class.

    :::code language="ruby" source="../demo/graph-tutorial/app/controllers/application_controller.rb" id="SaveInSessionSnippet":::

    The method takes the OmniAuth hash as a parameter and extracts the relevant bits of information, then stores that in the session.

1. Add accessor functions to the `ApplicationController` class to retrieve the user name, email address, and access token back out of the session.

    ```ruby
    def user_name
      session[:user_name]
    end

    def user_email
      session[:user_email]
    end

    def user_timezone
      session[:user_timezone]
    end

    def access_token
      session[:graph_token_hash][:token]
    end
    ```

1. Add the following code to the `ApplicationController` class that will run before any action is processed.

    :::code language="ruby" source="../demo/graph-tutorial/app/controllers/application_controller.rb" id="BeforeActionSnippet":::

    This method sets the variables that the layout (in **application.html.erb**) uses to show the user's information in the nav bar. By adding it here, you don't have to add this code in every single controller action. However, this will also run for actions in the `AuthController`, which isn't optimal.

1. Add the following code to the `AuthController` class in **./app/controllers/auth_controller.rb** to skip the before action.

    ```ruby
    skip_before_action :set_user
    ```

1. Update the `callback` function in the `AuthController` class to store the tokens in the session and redirect back to the main page. Replace the existing `callback` function with the following.

    :::code language="ruby" source="../demo/graph-tutorial/app/controllers/auth_controller.rb" id="CallbackSnippet":::

## Implement sign-out

Before you test this new feature, add a way to sign out.

1. Add the following action to the `AuthController` class.

    :::code language="ruby" source="../demo/graph-tutorial/app/controllers/auth_controller.rb" id="SignOutSnippet":::

1. Add this action to **./config/routes.rb**.

    ```ruby
    get 'auth/signout'
    ```

1. Restart the server and go through the sign-in process. You should end up back on the home page, but the UI should change to indicate that you are signed-in.

    ![A screenshot of the home page after signing in](./images/add-aad-auth-01.png)

1. Click the user avatar in the top right corner to access the **Sign Out** link. Clicking **Sign Out** resets the session and returns you to the home page.

    ![A screenshot of the dropdown menu with the Sign Out link](./images/add-aad-auth-02.png)

## Refreshing tokens

If you look closely at the hash generated by OmniAuth, you'll notice there are two tokens in the hash: `token` and `refresh_token`. The value in `token` is the access token, which is sent in the `Authorization` header of API calls. This is the token that allows the app to access the Microsoft Graph on the user's behalf.

However, this token is short-lived. The token expires an hour after it is issued. This is where the `refresh_token` value becomes useful. The refresh token allows the app to request a new access token without requiring the user to sign in again. Update the token management code to implement token refresh.

1. Open **./app/controllers/application_controller.rb** and add the following `require` statements at the top:

    ```ruby
    require 'microsoft_graph_auth'
    require 'oauth2'
    ```

1. Add the following method to the `ApplicationController` class.

    :::code language="ruby" source="../demo/graph-tutorial/app/controllers/application_controller.rb" id="RefreshTokensSnippet":::

    This method uses the [oauth2](https://github.com/oauth-xx/oauth2) gem (a dependency of the `omniauth-oauth2` gem) to refresh the tokens, and updates the session.

1. Replace the current `access_token` method with the following.

    :::code language="ruby" source="../demo/graph-tutorial/app/controllers/application_controller.rb" id="AccessTokenSnippet":::

    Instead of just returning the token from the session, it will first check if it is close to expiration. If it is, then it will refresh before returning the token.
